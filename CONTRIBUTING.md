   your work in a local branch of your own fork and then submit a pull
   request. If you do have write access to the repository, never work
   directly on master.

4. When the work is completed, submit a Pull Request.

5. Anyone can comment on a pull request and you are expected to
   answer questions or to incorporate feedback.

6. It is not allowed to force push to the branch on which the pull
   request is based.

   details are needed, specify a body.
